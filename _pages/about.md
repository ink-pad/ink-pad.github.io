Hi! My name is Inkit. I'm a researcher interested in fields of Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). My current work centers around improving the safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Currently, my primary focus and interest lie in safety/alignment, synthetic data generation, steering and influence-based attributions within LLMs.

My past research has encompassed various areas of deep learning, including but not limited to, learning representations for diverse modalities, counterfactual generation, interpretability, text style transfer, unsupervised learning, and more. I hold an MS in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.cs.usc.edu">USC/ISI</a>, where I also started my research career under the guidance of <a href="https://kevincrawfordknight.github.io">Kevin Knight</a>; our work on probing in sequence models established a foundational contribution to the field of interpretability.
